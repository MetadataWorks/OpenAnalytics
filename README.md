# Introduction

This repository contains json schemas that specify descriptive and structural metadata for datasets that could enable Federated Metadata Sharing. The schema was original developed to facilitate collaboration and metadata sharing between data catalogues.

# Overview

A common schema that defines the semantics and syntax of metadata about datasets is needed to enable metadata interoperability and sharing between data catalogues.

Initially the focus of this work is to define the common language and minimum number of entities needed to enable useful metadata sharing that can then feed into a Common API specification in the future.

The scope of the project is:

	- descriptive metadata: describes the content and context of a dataset such as title, author, abstract etc.
	- structural: describes the structure of a dataset inclusing table and field level definitions

Currently the descriptive metadata specification can be found here:
https://github.com/MetadataWorks/schemata/tree/release-2.0.1

The structural metadata can be found here:

ALSPAC is a multi-generation prospective cohort based in Bristol in the South West of England. More than 14,000 women (G0) were enrolled in 1991 and 1992. Their partners (also G0), children (G1) and now grandchildren (G2) have been recruited and followed up over multiple timepoints. A wide variety of biological samples have been collected along with a vast array of exposure and outcome data collected via questionnaire, face to face clinics and through linkage to administrative data. During the index pregnancy women were sent 3 questionnaires. Since then, over a period of some 25 years, women have been sent almost annual questionnaires asking about their own health and well-being. From 2008, women were invited to attend four focus clinical assessments. Assessments of the children have been administered frequently, with multiple data collection time points since birth. These include numerous child-completed questionnaires, a number of clinical assessments from the age of 7 years and further questionnaires about the child completed by the mother or other main caregiver. Partners of the mothers have also completed a number of questionnaires and been invited to one focus clinic assessment. The second generation (children of the children) have been and continue to be recruited with data collected via questionnaire and clinical assessment at multiple time points.

Whereas the qualitative data contains in depth interview data collected from patient, physician and different stakeholders from private and public health system in rural part of India. The purpose of this dataset collected is to assess the burden of CRD and its social and economic impact on the community and health system. Chronic Respiratory Diseases (CRD) especially asthma & Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) are common public health problems with high prevalence and mortality rates across the world. Although the majority of deaths and disability occur in developing countries, there is very little data on the true prevalence of asthma and COPD in these countries. Chronic respiratory symptoms are common in the general population but weak primary health care systems in resource-poor countries are often unable to diagnose the underlying disease condition. Factors contributing to low rates of diagnosis include limited access to, negative perceptions of, and lack of diagnostic capability in healthcare facilities. Determining the prevalence of asthma & COPD in the community has remained a challenge because of the poor sensitivity and specificity of the widely used questionnaire-based research tools, while spirometry, which is the gold standard diagnostic test, is a challenge to use in community-based epidemiological surveys.

This study had a broad interest in both the full range of tasks and the different situations in which ASHA work and the changing context in which their role is interpreted. This study therefore used a mixed-methods approach to assess and explore ASHAs\u2019 perspectives of their workload alongside that of local healthcare colleagues in both rural and village contexts. Background: Globally, Community Health Workers (CHWs) are integral contributors to many health systems. In India, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) have been deployed since 2005. Engaged in multiple health care activities, they are a key link between the health system and population. ASHAs are expected to participate in new health programmes, prompting interest in their current workload from the perspective of the health system, community and their family.    Methods: This mixed methods design study was conducted in rural and tribal Primary Health Centers (PHCs), in Pune district, Western Maharashtra, India. All ASHAs affiliated with these PHCs were invited to participate in the quantitative study, those agreeing to contribute in-depth interviews (IDI) were enrolled in an additional qualitative study. Key informants\u2019 interviews were conducted with the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, Block Facilitators and Medical Officers of the same PHCs. Quantitative data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Qualitative data were analysed thematically. Results: We recruited 67 ASHAs from the two PHCs. ASHAs worked up to 20 hours/week in their village of residence, serving populations of approximately 800-1200, embracing an increasing range of activities, despite a workload that contributed to feelings of being rushed and constant tiredness. They juggled household work, other paid jobs and their ASHA activities. Practical problems with travel added to time involved, especially in tribal areas where transport is lacking. Their sense of benefiting the community and respect and recognition in village brought happiness and job satisfaction. They were willing to take on new tasks. ASHAs perceived themselves as voluntary community health workers rather than as \\'health activists.\\' Conclusions: ASHAs were struggling to balance their significant ASHA workload, and domestic tasks. They were proud of their role as CHWs and willing to take on new activities. Strategies to recruit, train, enhance skills, incentivise, and retain ASHAs, need to be prioritised. Evolving attitudes to the advantages/disadvantages of the current voluntary status of ASHAs need to be understood and addressed in terms of working arrangements if ASHAs are to be remain a key component in achieving universal health coverage.

Evidence shows that COVID-19 infected patients with pneumonia may present on chest x-rays with a pattern that is difficult to characterise using only the human eye. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques using deep learning, which can consistently identify infected patients from non-infected ones given a radiographic examination of the patient, can be used as a reliable diagnostic tool. Considering chest x-rays are one of the most commonly performed radiological studies (coupled with the near universal availability of testing machines), applying AI techniques on them could prove to be valuable for COVID-19 diagnosis during clinical management. We therefore aim to establish a reliable diagnostic tool based on a deep-learning framework for the screening of patients who present with COVID-19 related abnormalities on chest x-rays. Over the course of 7 months we will build a dataset using open source data which are freely available, as well as with de-identified patient data collected from health institutions in Pakistan. Using this dataset, a deep learning model will be trained, which would be able to accurately screen patients who present with abnormalities relevant to COVID-19 in their radiographic examination. This tool will ultimately aid in expediting the diagnosis and referral of COVID-19 patients, resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

As not much is known about what actually contributes to poor asthma control in our region, improving understanding on factors related to disease burden could contribute significantly to improved asthma morbidity. The aim of this project is to develop a cohort of adults and children with asthma in Klang district in Malaysia to enable epidemiology, disease management and economic burden of asthma to be studied and interventions directed at patients and health care practice level to be carried out to improve asthma care.

Supported self-management has been shown to reduce asthma-related morbidity and mortality in high-income countries, but poor health literacy (especially in low- and middle-income countries) is a potential barrier to its effectiveness. This study aims to assess the feasibility of delivering supported self-management incorporating an adapted pictorial asthma action plan for adult patients with asthma attending a public primary care clinic in Malaysia. This study will proceed in two phases: 1) adaptation of the pictorial asthma action plan (AAP); and 2) a feasibility study including feasibility of assessing costs. Following the adaptation of the AAP, we assess the feasibility of using the AAP to support self-management in adults with asthma. In a pre-post study, 70 patients aged 18 years and above with physician-diagnosed asthma and currently prescribed inhaled corticosteroids will be recruited. Our proposed primary outcome is asthma control (Global Initiative for Asthma symptom control). A pre-piloted questionnaire will be used to collect baseline data on socio-demography, healthcare utilisation and expenditure, health literacy, clinical parameters (body mass index; peak expiratory flow rate).

We aim to repurpose and expand an existing pandemic reporting platform to determine the attack rate of SARS-CoV-2, the uptake and effectiveness of any new pandemic vaccine (once available) and any protective effect conferred by existing or new antimicrobial drugs and other therapies. Methods and analysis: A prospective observational cohort will be used to monitor daily/weekly the progress of the COVID-19 epidemic and to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in approximately 5.4?million individuals registered in general practices across Scotland. A national linked dataset of patient-level primary care data, out-of-hours, hospitalisation, mortality and laboratory data will be assembled. The primary outcomes will measure association between: (A) laboratory confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, morbidity and mortality, and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics; and (B) healthcare burden of COVID-19 and demographic, socioeconomic and clinical population characteristics. The secondary outcomes will estimate: (A) the uptake (for vaccines only); (B) effectiveness; and (C) safety of new or existing therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials against SARS-CoV-2 infection. The association between population characteristics and primary outcomes will be assessed via multivariate logistic regression models. The effectiveness of therapies, vaccines and antimicrobials will be assessed from time-dependent Cox models or Poisson regression models. Self-controlled study designs will be explored to estimate the risk of therapeutic and prophylactic-related adverse events. https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/6/e039097", "isPartOf": "BREATHE"}, "coverage": {"spatial": "Scotland", "typicalAgeRange": "0-150", "physicalSampleAvailability": ["NOT AVAILABLE"]}, "provenance": {"temporal": {"accrualPeriodicity": "MONTHLY"}}, "accessibility": {"usage": {"resourceCreator": "Public Health Scotland", "isReferencedBy": ["https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/10/6/e039097"]}, "access": {"accessRights": ["https://saildatabank.com/application-process/"], "deliveryLeadTime": "1-2 MONTHS", "jurisdiction": ["GB-GBN"], "dataController": "EAVEII team", "dataProcessor": "EAVEII team"}, "formatAndStandards": {"vocabularyEncodingScheme": ["READ", "ICD10"], "conformsTo": ["LOCAL"], "language": ["en"], "format": ["Excel Files", "R Files"]}}, "enrichmentAndLinkage": {"qualifiedRelation": ["GP data", "Electronic Communication of Surveillance in Scotland (ECOSS)", "Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) including SMR00 and SMR01", "Prescribing Information System (PIS)", "GP Out-of-hours", "NHS 24", "COVID-19 Community Hubs and Assessment Centres", "Scottish Hospital Electronic Prescribing and Medicines Administration (HEPMA) system", "Scottish Ambulance Service (SAS)", "Scottish Intensive Care Society Audit Group (SICSAG)", "COVID19 Clinical Information Network / International Severe Acute Respiratory and emerging Inflection Consortium (CO-CIN/ISARIC)", "Rapid Preliminary Inpatient Data (RAPID)", "National Records of Scotland (NRS) deaths", "Serology data", "Genome sequencing data", "Pregnancy and birth data", "Census 2011 data", "Child Health Systems Programme - School (CHSP-S)"], "derivation": ["Not Available"]}, "revisions": {"latest": "191c1e3f-4eff-41b9-bff1-c6510f7c6c3d"}, "HOP_status": "DRAFT"}, {"uuid": "7480abe4-e073-40ef-882d-217542b5e08e", "identifier": "https://web.www.healthdatagateway.org/dataset/7480abe4-e073-40ef-882d-217542b5e08e", "version": "0.0.2/DRAFT", "summary": {"title": "Effects of second-hand smoke on pregnant women: a phenomenological study", "abstract": "More than 40% of all pregnant women in Pakistan are exposed to second-hand smoke causing approximately 17,000 still births in a year.

Dataset contains qualitative interviews from phase 2, responses to quantitative questionnaire and qualitative interviews in phase 3.  Supported self-management for asthma (including action plans and regular review) is highly effective at improving asthma control, reducing acute attacks and the need for unscheduled healthcare. However, globally it is challenging to implement self-management in patients with asthma. One particular challenge is the need to tailor support for people with limited health literacy especially in low and middle income countries (LMICs) such as in Malaysia. In 2015, it was estimated that more than 90% of the Malaysian general population have limited health literacy. A tailored asthma self-management intervention, paying attention to the needs of people with limited health literacy, potentially could lessen health inequalities in Malaysia. This study is conducted in 3 phases. Phase 1 is a systematic review looking at effectiveness of asthma self-management interventions which address health literacy needs. We found gap in this area of knowledge. In phase 2, we conducted mixed qualitative and Photovoice, an arts-based qualitative study to explore lived experience of people living with asthma and limited health literacy in Malaysia. We found rich data on challenges and enablers around psychosocial themes on how people views asthma, self-management and experienced health literacy. We also explore the potential of technology i.e. mobile application to tailor asthma self-management support. Based on phase 2 findings, in phase 3, we developed and refined an asthma self-management mobile application with feedback from patients and health care professionals through a intervention design workshop which was conducted online.

For the management of common childhood illnesses, including pneumonia, in low-resource settings, adoption of Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) is globally recommended. IMCI classifications depend on the clinical assessment skills of service providers and this subjectivity might lead to misclassification and inappropriate referral/treatment. Hypoxemia (low levels of oxygen in the blood) is one of the strongest predictors of pneumonia mortality. Hypoxemia can be measured simply and effectively using pulse oximetry (PO).

Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions.

For example, in India, lung cancer often emerges on a background of chronic respiratory symptoms and is often not diagnosed at all \u2013 or at a very late stage. Because of late presentation and a range of other factors, survival from lung cancer in India is very low. At present we know very little about how knowledge and attitudes relating to CRD in poor, rural populations in India might be influenced by health and behavioural interventions. Psychological theory-based interventions must be culturally appropriate and grounded in the local context. As such, it\u2019s vital we develop this understanding if we are to change behaviours and reduce exposure to common risk factors, such as smoking and indoor cooking smoke. The PhD study aims to gather evidence through systematic review of literature about TPB based health interventions and conduct qualitative studies to inform the which constructs of TPB are important in developing an educational intervention which can effectively change the knowledge, attitude and health behaviour of people with CRD in these low resource settings.

In addition, the most recent study \u2013 \u201cIMPORT\u201d (Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood) contains data on the presenting symptoms that led to diagnosis of kidney cancer, an imaging archive of CT and MRI scans sent for central radiology review and biological samples (frozen tumour, blood, normal kidney) stored centrally on ~two thirds of cases. There is also tumour genomic copy number data available on about one third of the prior trial \u2013 SIOP WT 2001 (that ran in the UK, 2002-2011). Childhood renal tumour dataset This document describes the research dataset constructed through the Improving Population Outcomes for Renal Tumours of childhood (IMPORT) study from 2012 \u2013 2019 (https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/study-improving-treatment-children-kidney-cancer. The aim of this prospective clinical observational study is to achieve continuous improvement in short and long term outcomes for children with Wilms tumour and other rarer types of childhood renal tumours. The study collects clinical, molecular and imaging data to underpin the introduction of a more personalised approach to risk stratification \u2013 the process by which each child is assigned to one of several \u2018standard of care\u2019 treatment arms according to the predicted risk of their tumour recurring.  It is a live database, currently comprising data on 670 children with kidney tumours who are resident across the UK and Republic of Ireland. This represents >90% of all incident cases diagnosed in the population. Clinical data and patient samples are collected with explicit consent of their parent/guardian for use in research and for sharing with the relevant national cancer registration service according to where the child is resident at diagnosis. Data are collected throughout the patient journey and are presented in tables with each data item as a comma separated value (CSV) corresponding to a data field captured through a case report form (CRF). These span the following timepoints from presentation to completion of treatment and then annual follow up or reporting of any events (relapse/death/second tumour).  F1 Registration information F2 Pre-operative chemotherapy (Unilateral tumours only) F3 Surgical form \u2013 operative findings F4 Pathology form \u2013 institutional pathologist F6 Post-operative chemotherapy F11 Cardiotoxicity reporting form F12 Bilateral Wilms tumour form \u2013 additional registration information (12a) and response assessment (12b) F15 Reference Pathology \u2013 \u201cCentral review\u201d F17 Treatment of relapse or progression F18 Follow up form \u2013 for annual follow up reporting and to report any relapse or death. F20A End of treatment summary (Unilateral tumours) F20B End of treatment summary (Bilateral tumours) Details of the content of each CRF are in the table below. Most children (~90%) with Wilms tumour survive their cancer. Hence, an important aspect of the dataset is the planned linkage of each child\u2019s data to their national cancer registration record. This will permit measurement of very long term health outcomes in adulthood by linkage to routine health care data utilising the approved information governance systems through which the UK\u2019s national cancer registration services work with the NHS to ensure patient confidentiality.  The IMPORT study is one of five sequential clinical trials and studies that registered the majority of children diagnosed with kidney cancer in the UK and Republic of Ireland between 1980-2019 (over 3,000 patients). It is intended that these additional four closed trial datasets will be made available in the same way during 2020. These trials\u2019 primary endpoints, of relapse-free and overall survival according to clinically defined risk groups, have been published, with full clinical quality assurance completed. Over that 39 year period, risk stratification and treatment schedules have been refined many times, to reduce exposure to therapies that may cause long term side effects such as heart damage or second tumours. These adverse \u2018late effects\u2019 may take decades before they are first seen. Hence, these linked datasets are an important proof of principle about how very long term outcomes can be studied through linkage of clinical trials to routine health care data sources.  The IMPORT dataset will continue to be enlarged and enriched with tumour molecular information (copy number, genomic sequencing) and imaging review data (CT/MRI scans). These data items are not available for the previous closed trials.  Optional material if needed: Plans for the linked dataset with the national cancer registration and analysis service (NCRAS) of Public Health England.  This project will create a new permanent data linkage between each patient\u2019s trial identifier and data and their existing national cancer registration record, with all personally identifiable data being handled within the existing nationally approved information governance and data protection frameworks of the clinical trial units and the cancer registration service of each nation. The following technical description applies to Public Health England\u2019s National Cancer Registration and Analysis Service (NCRAS). Access to the linked community prescription data is made available through PHE\u2019s Office for Data Release. NCRAS routinely collects and quality assures clinical information on all cases of cancer that occur in people living in England to construct a cancer registration record. The data collected by NCRAS comes from several sources including Multi-Disciplinary Team meetings and pathology reports. The patient identifiers collected facilitate linkage to other routinely collected datasets, that include Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) with details of all admissions, A&E attendances and outpatient appointments at NHS hospitals in England, mortality data, the Systemic Anti-Cancer Therapy and Radiotherapy datasets from all hospital providers and community dispensed prescriptions data.  Patient-level linkage to inpatient HES is routinely processed by NCRAS. PHE receives pseudonymised dispensed prescriptions data from NHS Business Services Authority, allowing patient-level linkage to the National Cancer Registration Dataset without revealing the identities of those without cancer. Prescription data is available from April 2015 to February 2019, providing a 3-4 year window of prescription drug usage by survivors of childhood renal tumours.  The project\u2019s primary aim is addressed by calculating cumulative and relative risks of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions from the HES-linked data set and relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs compared to the general population rates. This newly created linked dataset can be refreshed for future follow up studies and linkage to additional datasets that may become available such as patient-reported outcome measures. For HES-based analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 1997 and date of renal tumour diagnosis. For community prescriptions analyses, follow-up will start at whichever is the later of 1 April 2015 and date of renal tumour diagnosis. For both sets of analyses, follow-up will end at whichever is earliest of death, emigration, latest date for which linked death certificate data are complete, and the latest date for which data are complete in the linked databases for HES or community prescriptions as applicable. Cumulative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated from the HES-linked data set with death treated as a competing risk. Relative risk of hospitalisation for specific organ dysfunctions will be estimated by dividing the observed number in the HES-linked data set by the expected number obtained by multiplying the number of person-years accumulated in each age-sex-calendar year stratum in the study cohort by the general population rate in the corresponding stratum calculated from the entire HES database. Relative risks of prescriptions for specific drugs will be estimated in a similar way using the linked community prescription data set and the entire community prescription database.

The data relates to the medical history of cancer patients prior to cancer, during their cancer diagnosis and treatment, and following their long-term outcomes, and the medical history of matched non-cancer patients that form a comparator cohort.

Where available, data from ResearchOne provides primary care information for these patients. Where the patients were invited to participate in a patient reported outcomes measures survey (PROMS), this status is recorded. Where the patient returned a consented PROMS, the PROMS data will also be available once it has completed the extract, transform and load process.  The dataset is currently 5.7 GB and further ResearchOne and PROMS data is anticipated. The dataset is arranged as a relational database, with tables linking on the patient level by a pseudonymous digest.

Demand is largely underpinned by ongoing epidemiological and cancer outcomes requests from University postgraduate researchers, PGT students, and other children\u2019s tumour registers. However, pharma has also requested some of the registry data. Ethics and Research Governance are all current, the former approved as a Research Database by the Northern & Yorkshire MREC (Ref MREC 0/3/1) from which data can be requested by external researchers, and approval from the Health Research Authority Confidentiality Advisory Group to process identifiable patient data without consent (Ref\u2014CAG 1-07(b)/2014). The Register goes beyond the dataset held by NCRAS in having much more rich and detailed treatment histories of every patient through active follow-up so beyond the traditional 6-month window since diagnosis used by NCRAS, as well as more complete tumour staging information. Register also records any cancer recurrence alongside any subsequent treatment received.  The Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People exists primarily to underpin epidemiological research examining the patterns and causes of cancer in children and young people and to facilitate health services research describing the patient experience in the context of care received by health professionals. The YSRCCYP is an established information resource for local clinicians and commissioners, and forms the basis for national and international collaborative research. The core aims of the YSRCCYP are to: \u2022 Maintain the accurate and complete collection of clinical and socio-demographic data on children, teenagers and young adults with cancer in Yorkshire, specifically information not otherwise available from other routine NHS sources. \u2022 Investigate the effectiveness of healthcare delivery for children and young people, specifically the impact on survival and long-term health. \u2022 Undertake epidemiological research, comprising incidence and survival analyses. \u2022 Describe environmental risk factors for childhood and young adult cancer. Example of three recent research studies by the Yorkshire Register research team are as follows: 1. Respiratory morbidity in young people surviving cancer: Population based study of hospital admissions, treatment related risk factors and subsequent mortality (Smith et al, 2019) Respiratory diseases are a major cause of late morbidity and mortality amongst childhood cancer survivors. This population-based study provides comprehensive analysis of hospitalisations for respiratory conditions, the associated risks of admission by earlier cancer treatment and trends in readmissions and subsequent mortality in long-term survivors of cancers diagnosed under 30 years. The risk of hospitalisation was significantly higher in cancer survivors compared to the general population. Treatment with chemotherapy with known lung toxicity was associated with an increased risk of admissions for all respiratory disease especially pneumonia. Subsequent mortality was highest in those admitted for pneumonia compared to other respiratory conditions. 2. Long term survival after childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia: population-based trends in cure and relapse by clinical characteristics (Smith et al, 2018) Statistical \u201ccure models\u201d provide additional metrics useful to identify and describe trends in survival. Additional measures include the proportion cured which is a summary of the long term survival and the median survival of the uncured which give information on those who are not long-term survivors. In this study we used a statistical cure model to explore trends in long-term survival and relapse for childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) over time and by clinical characteristics. The proportion of patients cured, defined either by overall survival or relapse free survival, has increased over time while there was slight decrease in the median survival time of the uncured. We also observed a significant reduction in the risk of relapse over time. 3. Comparison of ethnic group classification using naming analysis and routinely collected data (Smith et al, 2017) In this study we compared cancer incidence trends using different methods for assigning ethnic groups to individuals: 1 \u2013 using ethnic group recorded in hospital medical records, 2 \u2013 using a naming software program to assign an ethnic group based on the ethnic origins of the individuals and 3 \u2013 using a combination of both processes. We found that using different methods of assigning ethnicity can result in different estimates of ethnic variation in cancer incidence. Combining ethnicity from multiple sources results in a more complete estimate of ethnicity than the use of one single source. https://medicinehealth.leeds.ac.uk/leeds-institute-cardiovascular-metabolic-medicine/doc/yorkshire-specialist-register-cancer-children-young-people", "associatedMedia": ["https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27517468/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27517468/", "http://www.yhscn.nhs.uk/cancer/cancer-UsefulInformation/ChildrenandYoungPeople.php", "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/7771227.pdf", "https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjh.15424", "https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/cstream-node/child_surv_gb_type.xls", "https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/cstream-node/child_surv_gb_1510yr.pdf", "https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/cstream-node/child_surv_gb_1510yr.xls", "https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/sites/default/files/cstream-node/child_surv_gb_1510yr.ppt", "https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/health-professional/cancer-statistics/childrens-cancers/survival", "https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2011341", "https://www.nature.com/articles/bjc2011341", "https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12021957_Survival_from_adolescent_cancer_in_Yorkshire_UK", "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3241536/", "https://www.childrenwithcancer.org.uk/childhood-cancer-info/", "https://www.childrenwithcancer.org.uk/childhood-cancer-info/teenage-young-adult-cancers/", "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10673997/", "https://adc.bmj.com/content/89/4/380"], "isPartOf": "NOT APPLICABLE"}, "coverage": {"spatial": "Yorkshire, UK regional population based register", "typicalAgeRange": "0-19", "physicalSampleAvailability": ["BONE MARROW", "CANCER CELL LINES", "DNA", "PLASMA"], "followup": "1 - 10 YEARS", "pathway": "PRIMARY & SECONDARY"}, "provenance": {"origin": {"purpose": ["DISEASE REGISTRY"], "source": ["EPR"], "collectionSituation": ["PRIMARY CARE", "ACCIDENT AND EMERGENCY", "IN-PATIENTS", "OTHER"]}, "temporal": {"accrualPeriodicity": "QUARTERLY", "distributionReleaseDate": "2019-12-01", "startDate": "1974-01-01", "timeLag": "VARIABLE"}}, "accessibility": {"usage": {"dataUseLimitation": ["GENERAL RESEARCH USE", "GENETIC STUDIES ONLY", "RESEARCH SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS", "RESEARCH USE ONLY", "NO LINKAGE"], "dataUseRequirements": ["ETHICS APPROVAL REQUIRED", "INSTITUTION SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS", "NOT FOR PROFIT USE", "PROJECT SPECIFIC RESTRICTIONS", "TIME LIMIT ON USE", "USER SPECIFIC RESTRICTION"], "resourceCreator": "Professor Richard Fletbower University of Leeds", "investigations": ["https://dev.fundingawards.nihr.ac.uk/award/NIHR300693", "https://www.health.org.uk/funding-and-partnerships/programmes/augur-an-open-source-interactive-cancer-analytics-web-app", "https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81605261.pdf", "https://www.hra.nhs.uk/planning-and-improving-research/application-summaries/research-summaries/teenage-and-young-adult-cancer-survivor-study-tyacss-renewal/", "https://www.herc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/health_datasets/browse-data-sets/northern-and-yorkshire-cancer-registry-and-information-service-nycris"], "isReferencedBy": ["https://www.researchgate.net/scientific-contributions/38247 https://www.nature.com/articles/6603667584_Richard_G_Feltbower Publications Smith L, Stiller C, Lyngsie Hjalgrim L, Johannesen TB, Lahtennmaki P, McCabe M, Pritchard-Jones K, Steliarova-Foucher E, Falck Winther J, Woods R, Glaser AW, Feltbower RG.

Each centre includes several NHS Trusts and hospitals. GMCs recruit and consent patients. They then provide DNA samples and clinical information for analysis. Illumina, a biotechnology company, have been commissioned to sequence the DNA of participants. They return the whole genome sequences to Genomics England. We have created a secure, monitored, infrastructure to store the genome sequences and clinical data. The data is analysed within this infrastructure and any important findings, like a diagnosis, are passed back to the patient\u2019s doctor. To help make sure that the project brings benefits for people who take part, we have created the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP). GeCIP brings together funders, researchers, NHS teams and trainees. They will analyse the data \u2013 to help ensure benefits for patients and an increased understanding of genomics. The data will also be used for medical and scientific research. This could be research into diagnosing, understanding or treating disease.

So NCRAS can identify every cancer and ensure complete case ascertainment, it uses a wide range of data sources. These include data sent to NCRAS from: histopathology and haematology services medical records radiotherapy departments hospices independent hospitals screening services death certificates GPs other UK cancer registries By obtaining data from multiple sources and then matching and merging them as required, NCRAS can build a complete picture of the incidence and prevalence of cancer in England, as well as understanding how cancer patients are diagnosed, treated and their outcomes.

The Secondary Uses Services Payment By Results data set is derived from SUS+ and includes key data in support of the national tariff system which is used to determine the reimbursement of NHS funded care in England. Following the handover of responsibility for the NHS Payment system from DH to NHS England and NHS improvements (formerly Monitor) in April 2013, PbR was effectively replaced by the National Tariff Payment System (NTPS) in April 2014. This new payment system currently retains the vast majority of PbR policy. Due to the embedded terminology, data item and extract naming consistency, SUS continues to refer PbR in SUS and therefore the terms 'Payment by Results', 'PbR', 'National Tariff Payment System' and 'NTPS' should be considered interchangeable when using SUS or any SUS Guidance.  Payment by Results (PbR) provides a transparent, rules-based national tariff system, used to determine the reimbursement of NHS funded care in England. PbR rewards efficiency, supports patient choice and diversity and encourages activity for sustainable waiting time reductions. Payment is linked to activity and adjusted for casemix. This ensures a fair and consistent basis for hospital funding rather than being reliant principally on historic budgets and the negotiating skills of individual managers. PbR is the payment system in England under which commissioners pay providers of NHS-funded healthcare for each patient seen or treated, considering the complexity of the patient\u2019s healthcare needs.

The Core NDA collects information for a 15-month audit period.

Quarterly data collection The data is extracted quarterly from general practices via the General Practice Extraction Service (GPES). Indicative timings for extraction are: \u2022 August 2019: collection of data from January to June 2019 \u2022 November 2019: collection of data from January to September 2019 \u2022 February 2020: collection of data from January to December 2019 \u2022 May 2020: collection of full audit year data The first 3 quarters of data are typically published the month after extraction. The NDA started in 2003-4 as part of the Diabetes National Service Framework (NSF) implementation plan to provide reliable measurements for service improvement and monitor the impact of the NSF. The core components of the NDA were designed to align with the Diabetes NSF, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines and Quality Standards in respect of achievement rates for annual care process, and treatment targets and disease measure including premature mortality. It integrates data reflecting contributions from all primary and secondary care providers and captures data on over 3 million people with diabetes each year.  Since 2010 new elements have been incorporated into the audit programme to include specialised care pathways. The NDA programme now reports on: \u2022 Care processes and Treatment Targets (NDA Core) \u2022 Complications and Mortality (NDA Core) \u2022 Pregnancy in women with diabetes (NPID) \u2022 Foot ulcer management in people with diabetes (NDFA) \u2022 Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion in people with Type 1 Diabetes \u2022 Care of in-patients with diabetes (NaDIA) \u2022 Complications related to the four main harms that can occur to inpatients with diabetes in Acute hospitals in England (NaDIA \u2013 Harms) \u2022 Transitional care for people with diabetes through childhood to adulthood \u2022 Progress on invitation to attend and uptake of offer in the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme  The inclusion of NDA in the GP Contract allowed collection of data directly from primary care systems via the GPES for NDA Core primary care data. This has resulted in increased participation and reduction in burden on primary care providers due to the automated nature of GPES.

Research based on the RCGP RSC data have been published in the best journals including BMJ, Lancet and Diabetes Care. Observational research The disease surveillance program is commissioned by Public Health England (PHE) and covers 37 infectious diseases including influenza. The RCGP RSC is a nationally representative population. The RCGP RSC and PHE, and its predecessor organizations have an over 50-year history of collaboration in influenza and respiratory disease surveillance and vaccine effectiveness studies. Each practice in the network is reported on by all 37 infectious disease on a weekly basis and are graphically compared with the network as a whole (on their own web based dashboard); this drives both quality improvement in clinical care and also raises data quality, with our practice liaison team providing timely support to practices requiring help with any disparities in their information. Thus, the observational researcher benefits from a data warehouse of patient level records going back decades with consistently coded data, able to support both longitudinal and cross-sectional study designs. Interventional research \u2013 ambition to be a hub for trials The RCGP RSC has produced a \u2018Weekly Return\u2019 of infections and respiratory disease since 1967, though over time it has expanded in terms of size, scope, sample collection and its capability with linking with other datasets. The databases systems at the RCGP RSC can process large numbers of patients\u2019 data rapidly. The typical duration for generating the weekly report is under 4 hours. The weekly report reached its highest denominator of 3 million patients in last week of October 2019. The RCGP RSC hosts Workload Observatory (funded by NHS England) for GPs to understand trends of patients with multiple and more complex conditions. Using disease specific dashboards, general practices are provided weekly updated data quality indicators and comparison with other practices in the RCGP RSC network. This process allows practices to continuously improve their data quality and increase the quality of the RCGP RSC studies over time. We regularly administer questionnaires in our studies and are experienced in collecting samples from our network of practices. Practice level support from our dedicated practice liaison team is enhanced by our suite of dashboard technologies delivering rapid feedback to each of our practices. Hence combing our expertise in real world data analysis, high frequency of practice support and our continual development of internet-based practice level interaction, we are well placed for providing a low cost pragmatic trials platform for quality improvement studies or as a medicinal trials platform.  Clinical concepts are ontologically defined for clinical concepts as part of developing a study protocol. We have clinical and programming expertise to assist researchers in developing new ontologies for case finding and have a pool of existing ontologies and associated computer algorithms for extracting the data.   We have ongoing research across a wide range of medical areas, with international collaborations in child health, diabetes and influenza vaccination and have an extensive set of data extraction, processing and analytic procedures we have developed which are readily available to existing and new research collaborators.", "associatedMedia": [""], "isPartOf": "Not Applicable"}, "coverage": {"spatial": "England", "typicalAgeRange": "0-150", "physicalSampleAvailability": [""]}, "provenance": {"temporal": {"accrualPeriodicity": "SEMIWEEKLY", "distributionReleaseDate": "2019-12-11", "startDate": "1960-01-01"}}, "accessibility": {"usage": {"resourceCreator": "The Royal College of General Practitioners Research and Surveillance Centre (RCGP RSC)", "investigations": [""], "isReferencedBy": ["de Lusignan S, Correa A, Smith GE, Yonova I, Pebody R, Ferreira F, Elliot AJ, Fleming DM.

Costing process Applicants will be responsible for any costs associated with data extraction and other aspects of collaboration. Costs are kept to a minimum. However, a RCGP RSC Practice Development Fund contribution in included to develop benefits and data quality in member practices. Broadly 10% of the value of contracts is reinvested into member practices, in addition to any payments for research work undertaken. Any potential costs will be discussed at the monthly RCGP RSC Operational meeting, held each month, and researchers will be contacted as soon after the meeting as possible.

Administrative information is collected from the central PAS (Patient Administrative System), such as specialty of care, admission and discharge dates. After the patient is discharged the handwritten patient notes are transcribed by clinical coder into medical coding terminology (ICD10 and OPCS). The data held in PEDW is of interest to public health services since it can provide information regarding both health service utilisation and also the incidence and prevalence of disease. However, since PEDW was created to track hospital activity from the point of view of payments for services, rather than epidemiological analysis, the use of PEDW for public health work is not straightforward. For example: Counts will vary depending on the number of diagnosis fields used e.g. primary only, all fields; There are a number of different things that can be counted in PEDW e.g. individual episodes of care, admissions, discharges, periods of continuous care (group of episodes), patients or procedures. When looking at diagnosis or procedures the number will vary depending on whether you look at only in the primary diagnosis / procedure field or if the secondary fields are also included. Coding practices vary. In particular, coding practices for recording secondary diagnoses is likely to vary for different hospitals. This makes regional variations more difficult to interpret. The validation process led by the Corporate Health Improvement Programme and implemented by NWIS is aiming to address some of these inconsistencies. Due to the complexity and pitfalls of PEDW it is recommended that any PEDW requests for public health purposes are discussed with a member of the SAIL team.

LBSPL is dedicated to providing a sample processing service for clinical trials, and for many biobanking activities within the University and Leeds Teaching Hospitals Trust. These currently include collections of tissue, and fluid samples such as blood and urine obtained from consented patients diagnosed with kidney, bladder, colorectal and ovarian cancer, brain tumours, and patients undergoing renal transplant. These are processed and stored in research tissue banks (Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB and Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB) and used as a valuable resource for wider research activities. The Leeds Multidisciplinary Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 3rd March 2010 and renewed 5 years later (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0080).  Current situation: The LBSPL provides ongoing sample processing support to a variety of local or commercial clinical trials requiring samples to be collected for PK/PD endpoints or other associated translational studies. The Leeds Multidisciplinary RTB currently holds matched normal and malignant frozen renal tissue samples from ~600 patients with renal cancer, and plasma, serum, buffy coat and urine samples from ~800 renal cancer patients either prior to surgery/treatment or during treatment, for example with sunitinib. In addition, fluid samples have been collected from patients with benign urological conditions, healthy controls, patients prior to and following renal transplant A population-based TMA including tissue from ~300 RCC patients has also been established. From having solely a renal focus, the RTB has expanded to now also include frozen normal tissue samples, and frozen tissue and urine samples from >1,000 patients with bladder cancer, frozen tissue from patients with brain tumours and limited samples from patients with ovarian cancer or colorectal cancer (no new collections ongoing in these areas). The Leeds NIHR BioRTB has closed to recruitment and contains a bank of fluid samples from patients with liver disease, renal cancer and patient undergoing renal transplantation. These were collected as part of a multicentre initiative in the UK, together with associated clinical data, and are intended for use in biomarker validation studies.  Sample processing and clinical data: Samples are processed according to the relevant quality controlled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within Good Clinical Practice (GCLP) laboratories. The dedicated sample processing team of laboratory technicians, administrative staff and a Quality Assurance manager works together to ensure that all samples are handled, processed, stored and tracked to the highest standards. The samples are stored accordingly at the correct temperature (e.g. snap frozen tissue in liquid nitrogen, plasma, serum and buffy coats at -80oC). All freezers and liquid nitrogen dewars which hold patient samples are monitored using the Tutela system, a 24/7 web-based alert response temperature monitoring system. Full clinical data is being collected using CRFs. Follow-up data and data available later such as pathology results are obtained from the relevant hospital records/databases by trained personnel with appropriate access. We hope to move to more automated data linkage in the future through working with the Leeds Institute of Data Analytics.

The RTB was established for the multicentre collection and storage of samples from patients with liver diseases recruited within a randomised controlled trial (ELUCIDATE) of a biomarker panel, renal cancer patients and patients undergoing kidney transplant. The Leeds NIHR Biomarker RTB is jointly managed along with the Multidisciplinary RTB by the Joint RTB Management Committee. The Leeds NIHR Research Tissue Bank (RTB) was given favourable ethical opinion by the Leeds (East) Research Ethics Committee on 15th June 2010 (Current REC ref: 15/YH/0099).  Sample collections: Over the duration of the programme, 2,116 participants were recruited in total with 5,976 samples. Sample collection has taken place in multiple centres in the UK. These comprise: - 847 patients with liver disease each with a single serum samples - 514 patients on the kidney transplant waiting list including 312 subsequently transplanted, with 3,806 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine - 706 patients with suspected renal cancer (200 longitudinal and 506 cross-sectional) with 1,132 samples, including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma, buffy coat and urine and an FFPE tissue block (frozen available in Leeds patients only) - 149 healthy volunteers with 191 samples, each sample including multiple aliquots of serum, plasma and urine. All samples were collected according to SOPs and have been shipped from the participating sites and stored centrally in Leeds Biobanking and Sample Processing Facility. Associated clinical data has been collected using standard study-specific case report forms (CRFs), including long-term follow-up in many cases. Initially access to samples is prioritised for the needs of the Programme and investigators involved but additional collaborative access will then be possible.

Donors will have given consent for their samples to be used in a wide range of biomedical research applications, including genetic research and that undertaken by commercial organisations. We are also able to collect samples from specific donors, for example within a certain age range, ethnicity or with a specific blood group. We can collect samples into a wide range of anticoagulant tubes, blood bags and other devices as required. Processing We use advanced technologies in our laboratory to test donated blood samples and to process them into the formats which are most useful to researchers. These include: Whole blood From a single tube of whole blood in a specific anticoagulant tube, up to a full bag of blood we can collect the exact volume of blood you need from donors best suited to your study and deliver it within precisely defined timeframes at the best temperature for your need. Buffy coat We routinely process whole blood units into buffy coat preparations which are used as a source of PBMCs by our clients. We can also process smaller volumes of blood from blood collection tubes into buffy coat. Plasma We can either collect a specific volume of blood in the anticoagulant of your choice and prepare plasma, or you can source plasma samples that we have banked from a wide selection of donors for screening purposes. Serum We can either collect a specific volume of blood and prepare serum to suit your needs, or you can select from serum samples that we have previously banked from a wide selection of donors.

All participants provided a serum sample at recruitment with 50,262 providing further longitudinal annual samples (median of 9 samples). Women were free of any active malignancy at enrolment (2001-2005). During the follow-up period of >15 years to-date a proportion of those have subsequently developed a number of different diseases. Available comprehensive electronic health record linkage of the cohort's participants (including Hospital Episode Statistics (HES); ONS (Cancer registry, Death Certificates); National Cancer Intelligence Network (NCIN); and Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) allows exploiting clinical phenotyping and diseases diagnoses made during routine healthcare in the NHS. Women were also sent postal questionnaires. Secondary studies have to date generated additional data on symptoms, menopause and its management and further details of individual cancers. The biobank contains >540,000 high-quality serum samples (10 x 500\u00ce\u00bcL aliquots in straws), composed of baseline (from >189,000 women) and a unique longitudinal set of >350,000 annual serial samples (median 9) (from approximately 50,200 women).

The project is hosted by Cardiff University and receives funding from the Welsh Government, Cancer Research Wales and Velindre Charitable funds. A Cancer Bank is literally a collection of tissue and blood which has been collected from patients where cancer is a possible diagnosis and is being stored to facilitate future research into cancer. Statistics suggest that four out of ten people will be diagnosed with cancer at some point during their life. Cancers are complex diseases and it is an on-going quest to understand how they develop, spread and can be treated. The development of more effective, targeted treatment for cancer depends on increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation of the tumour, its progression to metastatic disease and response and resistance to treatment. Research studies rely on the availability of high quality biological material from patients with cancer and large studies are needed to correlate biology with clinical outcome. The Welsh population is relatively stable and this makes it an ideal cohort to collect and study. Linkage with the all Wales cancer clinical database (CANISC) enables good correlation of science with clinical follow-up. This will eventually enable the results from hundreds of research projects to be integrated and linked to clinical outcome and this will be an invaluable source of data for bioinformatics specialists to examine. All the data collected is being stored on a database housed in the NHS to ensure security and confidentiality. The WCB currently consents patients in 12 hospitals around Wales with specially trained research nurses and clinical teams.

It provided policy-makers with evidence that collecting blood more frequently than current intervals can be implemented over two years without impacting on donor health, allowing better management of the supply to the NHS of units of blood with in-demand blood groups. INTERVAL was designed to deliver a multi-purpose strategy: an initial purpose related to blood donation research aiming to improve NHS Blood and Transplant\u2019s core services and a longer-term purpose related to the creation of a comprehensive resource that will enable detailed studies of health-related questions. Approximately 50,000 generally healthy blood donors were recruited between June 2012 and June 2014 from 25 NHS Blood Donation centres across England. Approximately equal numbers of men and women; aged from 18-80; ~93% white ancestry. All participants completed brief online questionnaires at baseline and gave blood samples for research purposes. Participants were randomised to giving blood every 8/10/12 weeks (for men) and 12/14/16 weeks (for women) over a 2-year period. ~30,000 participants returned after 2 years and completed a brief online questionnaire and gave further blood samples for research purposes.  The baseline questionnaire includes brief lifestyle information (smoking, alcohol consumption, etc), iron-related questions (e.g., red meat consumption), self-reported height and weight, etc. The SF-36 questionnaire was completed online at baseline and 2-years, with a 6-monthly SF-12 questionnaire between baseline and 2-years. All participants have had the Affymetrix Axiom UK Biobank genotyping array assayed and then imputed to 1000G+UK10K combined reference panel (80M variants in total). 4,000 participants have 50X whole-exome sequencing and 12,000 participants have 15X whole-genome sequencing. Whole-blood RNA sequencing has commenced in ~5,000 participants.
